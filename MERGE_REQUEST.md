### **LifeOps System**

Inspired by DevOps and GTD, the LifeOps system is designed to manage life tasks through automation, continuous improvement, and AI assistance. It has various core components, such as issue creation, issue review, task prioritization, task implementation, feedback loops, and continuous improvement.

### Technological Backbone

- Backend: Python Flask
- Database: SQLite, with a potential migration to a NoSQL database or using Redis for caching.
- Frontend: Basic HTML/JS for MVP, potentially expanding to more robust frontend frameworks.
- AI Integration: AI for task prioritization and feedback, possibly powered by OpenAI's Chat API.

### **Data Objects and Database Structure**

### DataTypes

1. **User**
    - **`id`**, **`username`**, **`email`**, **`passwordHash`**, **`lifeDocId`**
2. **LifeDocument (LifeDoc)**
    - **`id`**, **`userId`**, **`content`**, **`timestamp`**
3. **MergeRequest (MR)**
    - **`id`**, **`lifeDocId`**, **`status`**, **`timestamp`**
4. **Issue**
    - **`id`**, **`lifeDocId`**, **`status`**, **`timestamp`**
5. **MRActivity**
    - **`id`**, **`MRId`**, **`type`**, **`refId`**, **`timestamp`**
6. **IssueActivity**
    - **`id`**, **`issueId`**, **`type`**, **`refId`**, **`timestamp`**
7. **Comment**
    - **`id`**, **`text`**, **`timestamp`**
8. **Test**
    - **`id`**, **`status`**, **`type`**, **`results`**, **`timestamp`**
9. **Reminders**
    - **`id`**, **`type`**, **`time`**, **`day`**, **`frequency`**, **`status`**, **`associated_MR_or_Issue_id`**
10. **CheckIns**
    - **`id`**, **`reminder_id`**, **`timestamp`**, **`response`**, **`status`**

### Relationships

- **User** to **LifeDocument**: One-to-One
- **LifeDocument** to **MergeRequest** and **Issue**: One-to-Many
- **MergeRequest** to **MRActivity**: One-to-Many
- **Issue** to **IssueActivity**: One-to-Many
- **MRActivity** and **IssueActivity** to **Comment** and **Test**: One-to-One
- **Reminders** to **MergeRequests** and **Issues**: One-to-Many
- **Reminders** to **CheckIns**: One-to-Many

### **Workflow**

1. **Issue Creation**: User or AI generates an issue that gets stored in the **Issue** table.
2. **MR Creation**: User or AI generates an MR, linking it to the **LifeDocument**.
3. **Review Phase**: AI assesses the MR or Issue through unit, integration, and regression tests, generating entries in **Test** and interacting via **Comment**.
4. **UAT (User Acceptance Testing)**: Real-world testing is conducted in four progressive phases.
5. **Merge or Closure**: The MR or Issue is either merged or closed based on the outcomes of UAT.
6. **Reminders and CheckIns**: Reminders are scheduled to facilitate the implementation and maintenance of tasks, and CheckIns record user's compliance or response.

The **LifeDocument** serves multiple roles:

1. Motivational force to keep commitments.
2. Planning document to provide a coherent life roadmap.
3. Source of truth for AI decision-making.

### **Merge Request (MR) System and Workflow:**

1. **Submission**: A user initiates an MR for a new goal, habit, or project.
2. **Review by AI**:
    - **Unit Test**: Checks if the MR abides by good practices, such as SMART criteria.
    - **Integration Test**: Examines conflicts with existing MRs and life goals.
    - **Regression Test**: Assesses any adverse impacts on existing tasks or objectives.
    
    The AI iterates with the user until all these tests are passed.
    
3. **UAT Phase 1 and 2**: Real-world testing for initial validation. Upon successful completion, the MR gets approved for merging.
4. **Draft MR Merging**: After passing UAT Phase 2, the MR is merged into the LifeDocument as an "ongoing" project with a link to the original MR for continuous review.
5. **Ongoing Review**: During weekly or other regular reviews, the open MR is discussed in relation to UAT Phase 3 or 4.
6. **Finalization**:
    - **UAT Phase 4 Completion**: Typically the completion of the project itself.
    - **Decision Point**: After completion, the MR can transition to a new MR, become a habit, or be archived.
7. **Closure**: Once the final decision is made, the MR is officially closed, and changes are reflected in the LifeDocument.

### **Example MR: "Learn to Cook Italian Dishes"**

1. **Submission**: User submits an MR to learn how to cook Italian dishes.
2. **Review by AI**:
    - **Unit Test**: Is the goal SMART? Yes.
    - **Integration Test**: Any conflict with existing goals like "Eat Healthily"? No.
    - **Regression Test**: Does it impact work-life balance? No.
    
    The AI approves all tests after minimal iterations.
    
3. **UAT Phases 1 and 2**: User cooks two simple recipes successfully.
4. **Draft MR Merging**: MR is added to the LifeDocument under "Ongoing Projects: Learn to Cook Italian Dishes (MR#25)."
5. **Ongoing Review**: During weekly reviews, the user discusses progress and any issues.
6. **Finalization**:
    - **UAT Phase 4**: User hosts an Italian dinner for friends and receives positive feedback.
    - **Decision Point**: User decides to make it a habit to cook an Italian dish once a month.
7. **Closure**: The MR is closed, and the LifeDocument updates to reflect the new habit.

This MR example demonstrates how the system allows for flexibility while maintaining structure, from initial proposal to completion and future planning.
